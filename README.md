# ChooChooChoose

This application is meant to randomly select a US passenger train name out of a
list of approximately 700 trains.

Why?

Well, we've decided to start following Basecamp's [six week work
cycle](https://basecamp.com/help/3/guides/how-we-work/six-week-cycle) at TSC
Advantage.  Basecamp names their work cycles after mountains and we, as a team,
thought that it would be fun to name ours after passenger trains.  We're doing
this for no other reason than it brings us joy.

# Getting started

After cloning the repo, run the following command to install the necessary
dependencies:

    % ./bin/setup

After install dependencies, start the server:

    % mix phx.server

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
